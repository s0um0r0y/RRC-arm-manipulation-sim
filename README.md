## RRC manipulation task

Week 0 – Environment Setup
Set up Python, PyTorch, MuJoCo, CVXPY, Stable-Baselines3
Run a basic MuJoCo simulation successfully
Week 1 – Robotics & Math Basics
Understand robot joints, end-effectors, frames
Implement simple forward kinematics and visualize trajectories
Week 2 – Control & Trajectories
Learn PD and impedance control concepts
Implement quintic position + SLERP orientation trajectory generation
Week 3 – Simulation Environment
Build a Gym-style dual-arm MuJoCo environment
Implement observations and resets (object pose, joints, end-effector states)
Week 4 – QP-Based Controller (Core DAVIL Component)
Implement CVXPY-based QP impedance controller
Enforce joint, torque, and end-effector constraints
Convert accelerations to torques and validate in simulation
Week 5 – Reinforcement Learning (PPO)
Understand PPO and actor–critic training
Train a PPO policy to predict stiffness values (K)
Integrate RL policy with the QP controller
Week 6 – Rewards, Stability & Logging
Implement DAVIL reward terms (tracking, infeasibility penalty, EMA smoothness)
Add logging, checkpoints, and seed control
Train stable policies on simple object cases
Week 7 – Full DAVIL Training
Train across multiple objects and masses
Evaluate tracking performance over many trajectories
